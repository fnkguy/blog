# The begining before the begining

> ### Is everything ready? Are the conditions met? Did someone thought ahead to make sure that no unnecessary steps must be taken?

He walks in and looks around. All seems calm and bright. Some thoughts cross his mind but, he keeps moving forward.

A few steps in and a couple of glimpses catch the corner of his, still squinted, eyes, almost make his blood cells run faster but, by now his mind is set. He knows what comes next, what needs to be done and he makes the effort to focus.

This is not the first time he does this.

The tools are all there and he knows the formula. Method, is the word. He starts with the raw materials, it has to be perfect. He prepares every thing so carefully, so patiently. Size, texture, time. Time is always there, ticking in his mind. It doesn't bother him, he is expecting it, controlling it.

The next phase is the mixture. Proportions are key. Temperature, technique, time. Time, again. The formula needs to come out right or he won't be the only one dealing with the outcome. As always, there isn't much margin for error. And the time..

The mixture is complete and the truth is about to be known. Form, color, smell but no time. He swirls it. The reddish brown liquid is done. Was he able to accomplish desired result? Is it what's expected of him? There won't be another try.

There is no one there with him, yet.. He grabs the container and fills it. It is time. There are no other thoughts in his head now. Only one thing matters in this moment, the beginning that has come to be so familiar to him. Will this be good enough?

After all the preparation, all comes down to this.. There is no turning back now. No matter what he has achieved, he knows, this is it. He smells it once again, pauses, its hot and it seems right. He takes it close to his mouth and takes a sip. Pauses again. He can feel it in his tongue, then in his throat and finally in his nose. His stomach is warm and so his body starts to be.

This is it. This is the beginning.

This is the cup of coffee that will jump start his day.
