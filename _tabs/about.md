> Hello there!!

My name is Filipe and I'm from Portugal. A beutiful and very welcoming country that, many people that many people think is just a province from Spain. :)

During the day I work as a cloud support engineer, more specifically, on an Identity team.

I've created this blog mainly because I want to start writing and posting short stories. This is something that I've been wanting to do for quite a while but never got from the idea phaze.. The blog marges this goal with technology, wich is something that I love.

Now, I'm not a writter, I don't have experience writting stories and I don't aspire to do anything with what I write other than... *write*.

Since I recently start reading more blogs (and have found them more interesting than social media) this may evolve into me sharing my own personal thoughts as well. In that case I will categorize them so they can be separated from the stories I may end up posting.

I'm also interested in (thus this blog may contain thoughts about) motorcycles, home brewed coffee, technology and (very importantly) Star Wars.

> I don't plan to monetize this blog. This is just for my own entertainment and for people who are interested in reading it, read it. :)
